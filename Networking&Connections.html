      <p>Networking is a vital part of career development because it helps you access opportunities that <br>
        aren’t always publicly advertised, gain insider knowledge about industries, and build relationships that <br>
        can lead to mentorship, referrals, or collaborations. It allows you to learn from others’ experiences, stay <br>
        informed about trends, and improve your communication and interpersonal skills. Whether through informational <br>
        interviews, professional events, or platforms like LinkedIn, networking helps you build a reputation, stay top of mind, <br>
        and open doors that might not be available through applications alone. Simply put, who you know,and who knows you,<br>
        can make a big difference in your career journey.</p>

<h2>How to Network Effectively:</h2>
<ol> 
<li><h3>Reach out to alumni or professionals for short informational interviews:</h3></li>

<p>Informstional interviews are informal conversation with someone working in an area <br>
that interests you who will give you information and advice.<br><br>

<b>*Note</b>:<i> It is not a job interview, and the objective is not to find job openings...but it is a very powerful networking tool!</i> 

 </p>

<li><h3>Attend industry events, career fairs, and conferences</h3></li>
<p>You can stay up to date on events <a href="https://www.si.umich.edu/about-umsi/events/subscribe-umsi-event-news-weekly-summary" target="_blank">Here</a></p>

<li><h3>Join LinkedIn groups or professional associations in your field</h3></li>
<p>Don't have a LinkedIn in? Go to this <a href="https://online.umich.edu/collections/career-kickoff/short/how-to-create-a-linkedin-profile/" target="_blank">Website</a> or sign up at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/" target="_blank">https://www.linkedin.com/</a></p>

<li><h3>Follow up and stay in touch with contacts after meeting them</h3></li>

<p>Writing emails is a great way to stay in touch in a professional manner. See below how to write an email to your network:</p> 
<p><b>Steve Dalton’s The 2-Hour Job Search promotes the use of a 5-point email as an effective message for networking.</b></p>

<ul>
<li>Keep it short! Try to keep it to 100 words or less</li>
<li>No mention of jobs/internships in subject or body</li>
<li>Connection goes first (e.g. UMSI connection)</li>
<li>Generalize your interest – make it easy for them to respond</li>
<li>Maintain control of the follow up. This gives you permission to follow up once</li>

</ul>

Subject: UMSI BSI Student Seeking Your Advice <br>
Dear Mr. Johnson, 
<br><br>
My name is Alexis, and I will be a senior in the UMSI BSI program at U-M this fall. I’m interested in learning more about careers in UX research, and <br>
I saw on LinkedIn that you currently work in UX Research at Google. As an alum, I know your perspective about your current role and the steps you took to get <br>
there would be very helpful. 
<br><br>
I would be happy to meet via phone or Zoom. I know this may be a busy time, so if we aren’t able to meet within the next two weeks, <br>
I'll be sure to check back in to see if sometime later this summer would work better. 
<br><br>
Thank you so much, <br>
Alexis
